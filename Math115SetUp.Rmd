# Math 115:  Set up your working environment 

## GitHub.    
Establish a GitHub account, it is free.  This is necessary because you will get write-up problems through GitHub.   You will also submit write-ups for grading by completing your assignment and pushing it to your GitHub account and the submitting the write-up URL.
a.	Got to https://github.com/  Select the ‘Sign Up’ button 

  
Select a username, I recommend you use your AVC email account and select your password.  BE SURE TO REMEMBER YOUR USERNAME AND PASSWORD. We suggest your AVC email as the username, and your AVC email password as the password. If you use something other than the AVC credentials, WRITE THEM DOWN.  These are username and password for you GitHub account.  If you forget either, you will not be able to access your GitHub account.

## Rstudio.cloud.   
Rstudio.cloud is the free software we use for statistical analysis and reporting.  Establish two Rstudio.cloud accounts, one using your AVC.EDU email address and one using another email address:  https://rstudio.cloud/  

Select the Free student account for both.  You need two Rstudio.cloud accounts because the free accounts limit you to 15 hours and 5 projects each.  We will link the two accounts

  1. Set up a shared account and a base project in each 
  2. In each individual account add these packages and their dependencies to your base project.  Here is the list tidyverse, tigerstats,knitr,car,leaps,leaps.  
  
### How to make a shared space  

### How to create a base project  

To install a base project you must be in a "shared space" first.  

Now go to your shared space and start a new project and name the project "mybase".

Change the "visibility" of the project so that everyone can see it.

Now go back to viewing all the projects in your shared space and click on
settings and make "mybase" the base project. 

Next, from the window where you made mybase the base project you edit it.

First add version control to it by going to tools -> version control -> git

Then choose tools -> Install Packages -> and choose tidyverse, tigerstats, knitr

Later we will come back and install more packages as we move through the course.

### How to link shared spaces, and invite others to your space
